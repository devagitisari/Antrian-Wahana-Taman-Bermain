## Amusement Park Ride Queue System

This is a console-based queue management system for amusement park rides.  
It allows park staff to efficiently manage ride queues with the following features:

- Set queue capacity
- Add visitors to the queue (enqueue)
- Remove visitors from the front of the queue (dequeue)
- View the current queue status
- Count empty slots in the queue
- Visualize the queue in a structured format

The program is implemented in Python and demonstrates the use of **queue data structure (FIFO - First In, First Out)**.
